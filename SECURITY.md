# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This repository contains research analysis code. We do not maintain longâ€‘term security branches. If you find a vulnerability, please report it.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Prefer **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** if enabled, or
- Open an **Issue** with minimal details and request a private contact channel, or
- If a contact email is listed in the manuscript, you may use it for sensitive reports.

We will assess the report and, when appropriate, document mitigations in this repository.
